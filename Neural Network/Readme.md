# Neural Network Layer Output Calculation
This code calculates the output of a single neural network layer given inputs and weights, with the addition of biases. The code uses the numpy library for matrix calculations.

## Inputs
The inputs are represented as a 2-dimensional array, where each row represents a sample and each column represents a feature.

## Weights
The weights are represented as a 2-dimensional array, where each row represents the weights for a single neuron in the current layer, and each column represents the weights for a single feature.

## Biases
The biases are represented as a 1-dimensional array, where each element represents the bias for a single neuron in the current layer.

## Output Calculation
The output of the current layer is calculated by taking the dot product of the inputs and weights, and then adding the biases. This is done using the np.dot function from the numpy library, and the result is stored in the layer_outputs variable.
