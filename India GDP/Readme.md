# Predicting the India's GDP using Machine Learning

This is a project to predict the India's GDP using Machine Learning.

## 1. Problem Definition

> How well can we predict the India's GDP?

## 2. Data

## 3. Model

> I'm going to use Linear Regression model.
> I'm going to use Decision Tree Regressor model.
> I'm going to use Random Forest Regressor model.

## 4. Predictions
