# Spectral Theorem

This is a project to demonstrate the spectral theorem. The spectral theorem states that any square matrix can be decomposed into a product of a unitary matrix and a diagonal matrix. The unitary matrix is called the eigenvector matrix and the diagonal matrix is called the eigenvalue matrix. The eigenvalues are the diagonal elements of the eigenvalue matrix and the eigenvectors are the columns of the eigenvector matrix.
